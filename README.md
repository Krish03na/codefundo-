Predicting and preventing natural disasters
My idea is to develop an app to help predicting and preventing the natural disasters. One of the biggest problem during a natural disaster is communication problem.People suffering from a natural disaster are unable to communicate or ask for help to others. This problem is solved with the help of this app. The people in a region will be connected through the app to all the people in that region and also with the experts that will guide the suffered people for what they should do.Also the people will be able to talk to each other and the experts.All the information about the coming disaster will be available on the app and people will be guided about what they should do so that they already become aware about the disaster.The people will also be connected to the rescue team to help the people who are stuck at a location.Also the rescue team will get to know about their location.Anyone in that region will be able to communicate through chat or voice call to any other person in that region.The app will contain all the contacts of the people in that region.This will also help them to get mental support from their relatives.
